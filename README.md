4. **Natural Language Processing:** NLTK, SpaCy
5. **Translation API:** Google Translate API
6. **Speech-to-Text API:** Google Speech-to-Text API
7. **Text-to-Speech API:** Google Text-to-Speech API
8. **Optical Character Recognition:** Tesseract.js
9. **Image Text Detection API:** Google Cloud Vision API
10. **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch
11. **Payment Processing API:** Stripe API
12. **SMS API:** Twilio
13. **Conversational AI Platform:** Dialogflow
